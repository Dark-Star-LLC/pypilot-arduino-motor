# pypilot-arduino-motor
PlatformIO version of the pypilot motor controller sketch.

We are using platform IO in order to program the arduino using Visual Studio, as a work around for problems encountered with Arduino IDE.

See [pypilot/.../arduino/motor/motor.ino](https://github.com/pypilot/pypilot/blob/master/arduino/motor/motor.ino) for the original source.  Also see:
